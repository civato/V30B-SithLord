V30B-SithLord
=============
Kernel from LG for ICS roms
V30B LG stock kernel customized with OC , ramhack , led dim , .......

OC possibility is thanks to the WKPARK patch.
I changed settings so 1000MHz is default startup speed.
I changed frequency table and voltage settings so it shows correctly in Antutu , SetCPU and SystemTuner.

The Led dim mod is @ pengus77
Ramhack mod @ WKPARK.

Governors added by civato: Lazy , Savagedzen, LionHeart, Scary, .......
Shedulers added by civato , except the row sheduler is by pengus77.

Nvidia patch for USB plugin BSOD fix.
